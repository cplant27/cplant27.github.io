        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p>T.O.A.L. uses a simple and intuitive syntax that makes programming a breeze. Here are some examples:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            # Automations make coding easy!

            automate greeting(name) {
              print "Hello " + name + " !";
            }
            greeting("World");
          </code>
        </pre>
        <pre>
          <code>
            # Simple variable declaration

            make x with 1;
            make y with "Make variables with ANY type!"
            make z with ["even", "a", "list"]
            constantly make C with "constants cannot be changed"

            # and even simpler incrementation
            
            add 1 to x;
            subtract 1 from x;
            multiply x by 1;
            divide x by 1;

            # Say goodbye to those confusing math symbols!
            
            change x to 5;
            make a with 2 plus x minus 7;
            make b with 2 to the 9 minus (y divided by x) times x to the 0;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <pre>
          <code>
            # While loops
            
            make x with 0;
            loop while x is less than 5 {
                add 1 to x;
                break;
            }

            loop over element in this_list {

            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <pre>
          <code>
            # Even conditionals

            make x with 5;
            if x is 5 { 
                print "x is 5";
            }
            ifnot {

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>CJ Plantemoli</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>I've dedicated my life to creating this programming language. As a kid, 
            I was always fascinated with computers, and I knew I wanted to make a career out of it. 
            I started coding in high school, and when I got to college, I met Sam, Chris, and Jayden. 
            Together, we worked tirelessly to develop this language, drawing on our combined knowledge 
            of computer science and AI.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chris Jansky</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>I've always been fascinated by programming languages and their ability to shape the way we 
            interact with technology. Together with CJ, Sam, and Jayden, I've poured countless hours into 
            this language, carefully designing it to be powerful, efficient, and easy to use. I'm proud of 
            what we've created, and I can't wait to see what people will do with it.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sam Richard</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>I'm passionate about programming and the endless possibilities it offers. I've spent countless 
            hours working on this language, constantly tweaking and refining it until it's just right. As 
            part of this project, I've worked on everything from the syntax to the compilers, always striving 
            to make this language the best it can be.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Jayden Craig</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>I've always had a love for computers and programming, and I knew from an early age that I wanted 
            to create my own language. As part of this project, I've spent countless hours coding and debugging, 
            always pushing the boundaries of what's possible. With CJ, Sam, and Chris by my side, we've created 
            a language that's truly unique, and I can't wait to see where it takes us.</p>
